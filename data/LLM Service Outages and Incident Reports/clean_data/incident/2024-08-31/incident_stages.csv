LLMs generate responses by randomly sampling words based in part on probabilities. Their “language” consists of numbers that map to tokens.
In this case, the bug was in the step where the model chooses these numbers. Akin to being lost in translation, the model chose slightly wrong numbers, which produced word sequences that made no sense. More technically, inference kernels produced incorrect results when used in certain GPU configurations.

The issue was triggered by a critical error in our routing mechanism.
We were immediately alerted to the failures and rapidly identified the root cause as an interaction between our ChatGPT service and the downstream services, which was triggered by a new release of our ChatGPT backend.
After identifying the root cause of the issue, we took action by rolling back both the backend and the ChatGPT services to their previous stable versions. This action restored normal service operations.
‌
The detailed incident timeline is as below:
2:33 pm, 29th Jan 2024: Culprit PR deployed to the backend service.
4:17 pm, 29th Jan 2024: ChatGPT new deployment. The issue in the downstream service was only triggered when ChatGPT deployed.
4:19 pm, 29th Jan 2024: Impact becomes apparent in monitoring systems and alerts fire notifying engineers.
4:22 pm, 29th Jan 2024: Root cause identified.
4:28 pm, 29th Jan 2024: Rollback mitigation started.
4:34 pm, 29th Jan 2024: Traffic fully recovered.
‌
As part of the incident response, we are taking immediate measures to prevent similar issues in the future, including:
Evaluating dependency enhancements - strengthening our downstream system to prevent issues caused by dependencies between services.
Adjustments to the code roll out strategy for the downstream service to do in phases.

This peaked at a 75% failure rate on paid and free ChatGPT.
This outage was triggered by maintenance on a PostgresDB service used by OpenAI’s Primary API service that caused both read replicas to fail at the same time. Although only the read replicas for this database were affected, they are load-bearing, causing request paths dependent on them to fail. The Primary API service provides user authentication and service-to-service authentication across the entire OpenAI stack.
After multiple unsuccessful attempts to both revive either of the failed replicas, as well as to bring up replacements in other regions, the issue was ultimately mitigated by working with our service provider to bring two new replicas in the same region into service.
‌
As part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:
A moratorium on similar maintenance activities till further notice.
Adjusted configuration settings to reduce connection churn.
Added a feature flag which lets us shift traffic away from replicas on a percentage based rollout
We have tested directing 100% of the queries to the primary instance and verified our hypothesis of why the primary failed.
‌
Additionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future similar incidents altogether:
Fundamentally OpenAI needs to ensure that maintenance windows do not result in widespread service outages. To that end we will:
Establish a pre-maintenance review process to review all upcoming maintenance activities to ensure that in the event of an unexpected outage, a plan to rapidly recover is in place.
Ensure adequate buffer capacity is available as “hot” standbys during maintenance activity.
Ensure adequate buffer capacity is available in regions where critical services are hosted.
The DB maintenance caused the replicas to go offline/out of sync which led to replica lag increasing unboundedly. Develop (short term) strategy / automation for rapidly recovering from replica lag and (long term) architectural changes to eliminate this factor.
Examine our entire infrastructure and services stack to ensure we add more redundancy and fail safe mechanisms for greater resilience.

All models and API endpoints saw significant failures over the course of the event.
The outage occurred due to routing layer nodes hitting memory limits and failing readiness checks. Eventually, a sufficient number of nodes in the service became unavailable, that there wasn’t sufficient capacity to serve the incoming traffic and the service was unable to recover. That morning, there were dramatically more completions than any prior day, which we believe was the sufficient tipping point for the service.
The issue was mitigated through a combination of limiting incoming traffic, redeploying the service en masse and then slowly ramping the traffic back up.
‌
As part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:
‌
The underlying issue which led to the chronic memory issues, was that we were continually allocating a new responseBuffer in a loop rather than reusing it. This was causing GC to get behind, particularly when there were lots of requests. The fix was to pre-allocate the buffer and reuse it. Since shipping, we have seen a 3X improvement in both memory and CPU usage.
We have adjusted the configured memory limits to an appropriate level and the service now has significant available headroom.
We have implemented a series of rate limit controls to more gracefully load shed traffic.
As an additional precaution, we increased the service’s capacity.
‌
Additionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:
Implement a series of alerting changes to catch the underlying memory behavior before they escalate into potential service issues.
It was not possible to enable auto scaling on this service in the past as adding capacity to it could negatively impact an upstream service. The underlying issue has been rectified and we will configure auto scaling for this service.

This peaked at a 60% failure rate for GPT-3.5-Turbo API traffic, a 70% failure rate for GPT-4 API traffic, and similar failure rates for all other API endpoints. Additionally, a fraction of ChatGPT Enterprise traffic was affected as well.
The root cause was identified as our Redis authentication cache becoming largely unresponsive due to shards failing while the cache was already under high load. Because our authentication system was not resilient to such a cache failure, this led to a significant fraction of timeouts when authenticating. Due to the user-keyed nature of the authentication system, some users were heavily affected while others were not at all – some API customers saw all requests fail, while others only saw a small percentage fail.
After identifying the root cause of the outage, we took immediate action by attempting to scale up the existing Redis cluster, as well as separately provisioning a new, larger Redis cluster with higher resource limits. However, fully restoring the service took longer than we anticipated. While the service improved periodically over the course of the outage, the issue was only fully mitigated by 9:15pm.
As part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:
Scaled up the Redis authentication cache to be able to handle traffic even in the presence of multiple shard failures
Modified our cache miss and failure backoff policies to decrease the rate of requests to the cache when it is struggling to serve requests
Additionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:
Improve monitoring and alerting for our caching and authentication infrastructure
Hardening our authentication system against degradations in caching services, so issues with our authentication caches don’t take down all traffic.

Some customers, particularly those using fine-tuned models, also observed HTTP 429 errors, with a message that the requested model was still being loaded. And in some instances requests were dropped with HTTP 503 errors.

We have taken immediate steps to resolve these issues. We’ve also made investments, and prioritized others, to ensure we never encounter these issues again, even as our request volume continues to increase.

We rolled out a fix, and have observed performance returning to expected levels. This incident is now resolved.",1,2024-05-29 16:24:00+00:00,"On May 21, 2024 from 11:25 am PT  to 12:26 pm PT a large portion of requests to ChatGPT gpt-4o free tier were failing with 5xx status codes.
‌
At 11:30 am PT, engineers noticed that the configured routing information for gpt-4o had no backing services anymore and took immediate action to reapply the expected configuration to the system. First, rate limits were decreased for free tier traffic to prevent overwhelming the few instances that would be backing gpt-4o. Traffic was slowly dialed back up as the system performing re-configuration slowly added more and more of the backing services to the routing configuration. Due to the nature of the systems, this configuration process ramps up traffic in a staged manner and takes several minutes in between steps to configure more capacity for a service, hence the large length of the incident relative the time to execution of a mitigation.
‌
The root cause was later determined to be a code bug in a new code path to enable draining all workloads in a cluster, an operation that was being attempted for the first time.
An error in the logic led to a misconfiguration that resulted in 100% loss of the services that back gpt-4o free tier, spanning multiple clusters, instead of just impacting a single cluster. This meant there were no backing services configured to answer requests for gpt-4o free tier traffic, in line with the symptoms observed by the triaging engineer.
‌
The core bug causing the incident has been fixed.
Further hardening is being undertaken to introduce inertia to the process of cluster drain as to avoid the same level of catastrophic loss and to prematurely warn operators before large actions are taken.
The systems are also being adapted to better explain specifically what actions will be performed when enacting such large operations.
Additionally, the team is making it easier to more quickly undo changes, something that prevented us from reverting the issue more quickly.

‌
The outage occurred due to a control plane service for one of our ChatGPT clusters degrading as a result of memory exhaustion. This resulted in cascading failures across multiple services. The team shifted traffic away from the problem cluster to a healthy cluster, scaling that cluster up in the process. This caused the second cluster to fail as the increase of pods resulted in more requests to the control plane service that that cluster utilizes.
Rate limiting to reduce the inbound traffic volume was applied, which led to many users receiving a misleading error message.
‌
The issue was mitigated by increasing the available memory on the Kubernetes control plane and rebalancing traffic.
‌
As part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:
Adjusted the available memory for control plane services.
Modified the services which make the majority of the requests to the control plane to reduce the volume of calls that they make.
Implemented improved monitoring for the control plane and relevant other symptoms that we observed.
Modify the messages that users receive when using one of our rate limit configuration switches.
‌
Additionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:
More thorough monitoring of the control plane services provided by our infrastructure provider.
‌

DALL·E image generation tasks used to be canceled after five minutes. On Friday, March 17th, the engineering team reduced that timeout to one minute.

This was fixed by reallocating capacity to DALL·E, and changing queuing and retry logic.

This was due to some of our hosts unexpectedly encountering network connectivity issues. These manifested as the inability to resolve DNS and failures in internal node diagnostic services. We believe these network connectivity issues were triggered by sudden changes in external traffic patterns that overwhelmed the network stacks of some hosts.
Once we identified the root cause, we were able to adjust to the new traffic patterns and take unavailable nodes out of circulation. Response time was exacerbated by this also causing our primary monitoring service to go out, as well as there being unrelated hardware problems on some of the affected nodes.

Ongoing database instabilities left some non Completions services degraded until 1:30pm PST on Feb 21. The root cause was an unexpected database failure with compounding effects delaying full recovery.
Our primary Postgres database was scheduled for a routine automated maintenance by our cloud provider. During this window, no impact was expected because the primary would fail over to a hot standby to continue to serve traffic. This ran as expected. However, additional ""read replica"" databases were also scheduled for maintenance in the same time window but had no corresponding fail-over functionality. The read replicas unexpectedly failed to come back after their maintenance window. The result was that we were able to keep parts of the site up and running, but not enough database capacity to service all traffic.
Engineers immediately started two streams of work. One was to create new read replicas. The other was to rebalance the available database connections towards the most critical API endpoints. Completions and authentication traffic were prioritized. This brought back traffic to the main /v1/completions endpoints by 2:05 am PT on Feb 21. The length was compounded by existing read replicas unexpectedly getting stuck in a recovery loop and being unable to reconnect to the primary database. This was additionally compounded by delays incurred spinning up new replicas due to unexpected dependencies from non-on-call staff in the middle of the night on a holiday weekend and during a holiday Monday on-call shift change.
Throughout the night we continued to see database instabilities; however, isolation procedures were able to keep /v1/completions online. Unfortunately due the volume of ChatGPT and Dall-E these products remained degraded due to database instabilities.
We use PgBouncer to pool database connections; unfortunately in the post-recovery database configuration we identified previously unknown slow queries hogging the pools, preventing other queries to run. Database instabilities were further frustrated by new read replicas inadvertently bypassing PGBouncer and exceeding database connection limits. This caused an additional brief outage from 10:43 am to 11:04 am PT.
By 1:30pm read replicas were fully online and ChatGPT and DALL·E returned to a fully operational status.
We are immediately executing on several action items as a result of this outage:
We are working with our cloud provider to be better prepared for how future maintenance will affect read replicas to minimize impact.
Whenever possible, we will adjust maintenance windows to occur during normal working hours so more staff is readily available
We are adjusting caches to persist with longer TTLs if the database is unavailable, allowing some critical endpoints to continue functioning for longer.
PgBouncer configuration is being tuned to account for slow queries
We are moving our on-call rotation to Tuesdays to avoid scheduling confusion of 3-day-weekend holidays.
We are reviewing our on-call access policies and escalation channels to ensure that on-call has knowledge and access to all necessary dependencies to remediate an outage
Longer term, we are reviewing our overall database strategy and planning towards solutions that are more resilient to individual server failures.",2023-02-21 07:40:00+00:00,2023-02-21 12:09:00+00:00,0 days 04:29:00,False

Capacity was fully stabilized in approximately four hours.
The problem was due to a configuration change of ""CNI"" - the Container Network Interface plugins used to provide network connectivity to containers running on our clusters. Given the high demand of our services, we go to great lengths to utilize any and all GPU capacity available. This involves supporting a variety of different hardware and networking configurations, requiring different CNI configurations. We fully tested this CNI configuration change in a staging environment prior to deployment, but unfortunately our staging environment lacked one particular variation of hardware that only exists in production. The CNI change was incompatible with those servers and caused their workloads to lose network connectivity. 
Engineers immediately identified the problem as due to network connectivity, but it took nearly an hour for CNI to be identified as the cause. The CNI change had been deployed to other clusters over the past 24 hours, so had been deemed safe. The problem only arose once that change had been deployed to a cluster with different hardware. Once the problem was identified, a fix was in place and restored 80% of traffic immediately.
Though the network and servers were back up and running, problems related to model deployment continued to affect our reliability over the subsequent 3 hours. Some issues were due to known bottlenecks in our network and storage infrastructure, limiting how many models we can load back onto GPUs at a time. Other issues are due to misbehaving bad hardware that need to be identified and removed from operation. We are actively working on addressing those limitations this quarter.
We are addressing several action items as a result of this incident. Staging environments will contain a representation of all possible types of hardware configurations so that it is a better representation of production. The health of our CNI system itself will be directly monitored and alerted, so that failures will be more readily visible. We are fixing the bottlenecks in network and storage infrastructure that constrain our ability to deploy many replicas of a model quickly.",2023-01-26 01:13:00+00:00,2023-01-26 05:50:00+00:00,0 days 04:37:00,False

The outage lasted 57 minutes. No other models were affected during this outage.
Engineers had been conducting a routine upgrade of one of our clusters when we started seeing a low level of internal network connectivity problems. We identified the networking issues to be due to increased scale - a larger number of connections was leading towards ""SNAT Port Exhaustion."" Engineering moved quickly to add additional network capacity. The configuration change to upgrade the network overrode the in-flight upgrade of the cluster, causing the cluster to unexpectedly rollback. This disrupted workloads powering the text-davinci-002 model.
The problem was identified in less than 2 minutes. It took approximately 30 minutes to restore capacity on the cluster, and an additional 25 minutes for workloads to start operating normally.
This outage is regrettable. We will be addressing gaps in our change control process to ensure that conflicts between two in-flight changes does not result in unexpected outages. We are also adding cluster redundancy so that a single cluster outage has overall far less impact on our services. Both of these changes were already planned and are actively being implemented.",2022-11-17 17:57:00+00:00,2022-11-17 19:41:00+00:00,0 days 01:44:00,False

ChatGPT and Platform API services are fully operational. This issue has been fully resolved.",1,2024-08-23 21:27:00+00:00,"On August 16, 2024 from 11:38 AM to 1:16 PM PT, a significant issue impacted the reliability of the OpenAI primary API, resulting in degraded service for users. This incident led to reduced success rates for ChatGPT conversations and affected login and account creation processes. The incident occurred in two waves, lasting 44 and 15 minutes respectively.
‌
The root cause was a combination of factors. A scheduled maintenance and an upgrade to the ingress of the OpenAI user-facing clusters introduced a networking control plane regression. This manifested itself in a short-lived data plane outage. As a result of the momentary loss of connectivity, a set of services became unhealthy and were automatically restarted. The restarts, however, took much longer than expected as the services starting up overwhelmed a backend persistence store with a heavy first-start query. The backend persistence store required additional time to catch up and recover.
‌
As part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:
‌
We have mitigated the networking control plane regression, and validated that control plane restarts do not interfere with the clusters' data plane
We implemented software changes to improve services' start time and remove first-start query alleviating pressure on the persistence layer and speeding up start and restart of services.
Deployed configuration changes to optimize networking control plane's effect on clusters ability to handle traffic
Removed the expensive database query from critical startup paths
Implemented additional monitoring and alerting for networking control-plane related issues
‌
Additionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:
‌
We are introducing staged rollouts for infrastructure changes with longer soak time to ensure regressions are caught as early as possible and affect as few systems and users as possible.
We are auditing our systems for other slow queries that may affect service start time.
‌
We are continuing to improve our infrastructure to ensure greater resilience and faster recovery in the event of future incidents.
‌
We know that extended API outages affect our customers’ products and business, and outages of this magnitude are particularly damaging. While we came up short here, we are committed to preventing such incidents in the future and improving our service reliability.",2024-08-16 18:53:00+00:00,2024-08-17 00:35:00+00:00,0 days 05:42:00,False

‌
The incident involved three main issues:
‌
An inference engine issue prompted the initial rollback
A series of cascading issues occurred with our event bus infrastructure resulting in IO-blocking across the ChatGPT service, which prevented requests from completing.
A bug caused ChatGPT users to receive empty completion responses.
‌
During the initial rollback, there was an unexpected degradation in an event publishing flow. Due to recent infrastructure changes, and the deployment, we experienced an abnormally high number of requests to a schema service which led to increased latencies. A 3rd party library executing these requests used an IO-blocking behavior that caused processes to stall, resulting in ChatGPT requests timing out and returning 504 errors. We rolled forward to mitigate this and ChatGPT requests no longer experienced 504s.
‌
We began to notice that conversations responses appeared to be successful but were usually empty. We identified that this is a regression due to recent code changes. The regression was fixed and we rolled forward again to mitigate the regression.
‌
As part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:
Removed the IO-blocking behavior that occurred during event publishing.
Added caching to the schema service.
Implemented additional monitoring for the schema service.

The team initially attempted to mitigate in a variety of ways, including restarting the primary server and assessing failover options to other replicas. Despite the various attempts at recovery, the primary database continued to be unreachable. We eventually blocked all traffic to ChatGPT to remove all load from the DB and were able to promote a secondary target to be the new primary and began redirecting traffic to it. Re-ramping incoming traffic concluded at 10:07 AM at which time, all services were recovered.
‌
As part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:
Tuned the number of connections the pooling service makes to the DB backend.
Increased timeouts on connections made to the DB to avoid deadlocks.
Implemented exponential backoff, gradually increasing the wait time between subsequent retry attempts for DB connection failures.
Modified our load shedding tooling to make it easier to degrade more gracefully.
‌
Additionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents of this type altogether:
Re-architect the DB design to increase its redundancy.
Improve our ability to load shed at the DB layer (in addition to the clients).
Expand the load testing and benchmarking we do for the backend layer.",2024-06-04 14:33:00+00:00,2024-06-04 17:17:00+00:00,0 days 02:44:00,False

All customers making API requests at this time were affected by this outage. The network outage lasted approximately one hour. Upon network traffic returning, some customers continued to see elevated errors when making requests to some models and to our Moderation API, and when making changes to their billing settings. Within two hours these cascading issues were fully resolved.
Engineers quickly identified that the problem was related to our public load balancer. All visible configuration and monitoring indicated that the load balancer was operating correctly. We escalated to our cloud provider to help with the investigation, who later determined that an unrelated change to our network configuration broke our public load balancer in a way that was not visible to us.
Approximately half of traffic was restored an hour after the incident began. But unfortunately after such a long period of outage, internal automation then further hindered our ability to serve the full load. Over the subsequent two hours, engineers manually worked to get all systems back online.
This multi-hour outage went on for far too long. To enable faster recovery times in the future, we're implementing changes to further increase observability and increase robustness of our change control processes.
‌
In the course of investigation, engineers have identified the underlying issue in how network configurations get propagated that caused the load balancer to unexpectedly break, and have been able to reproduce the issue in a test environment.

The outage affected infrastructure for more recently fine-tuned curie models (older models are running on separate infrastructure and were unaffected). Overall this represented 80% of requests to curie fine-tuned models.
The cause was a failure of the pub/sub system we use to queue requests. Even though the specific pods responsible for pub/sub were brought back up, there were cascading failures that prevented traffic from recovering. 
The mitigation involved standing up a new infrastructure to process these requests. This was brought up and put into production traffic at around midnight, at which point failures stopped. Because new systems have some startup costs and cold caches, there was still higher latency observed for around 10 minutes.

- Legacy curie, babbage, and ada

Thank you for your patience.,1,2022-06-28 03:20:00+00:00,"Summary:
On June 23, 2022 18:56 PDT (June 24 01:56 UTC), the following models went offline: 
Some Fine-tuned models: curie and davinci
Some Codex beta models: code-davinci-001, code-cushman-001
Some legacy GPT models: curie, babbage, and ada
All Embeddings models
Codex, Embeddings, and Legacy GPT models were completely unavailable for about an hour. Fine-tuned Curie was failing for most requests for 5 hours. Fine-tuned Davinci was failing for most requests for 12 hours.
The main cause was that one of our three production clusters went completely offline. Once that cluster went down, we needed to re-allocate models to our remaining two clusters. The downed cluster took 10 hours to fully restore due to several unexpected events detailed below. While most models recovered before the cluster was restored, Fine-tuned Davinci was not able to fully recover until the cluster was restored.
What happened to fine-tuned models:
Fine-tuned Curie was timing out for most requests until 00:10 PDT (5 hours). Fine-tuned Davinci was timing out for most requests until 06:40 PDT (12 hours). There were several reasons why fine-tuned models took so long to restore.
While we normally keep healthy infrastructure headroom, these margins were exhausted with the loss of an entire cluster. For us GPUs are the most constrained resource. Due to fundamental supply chain constraints we are unable to provision more GPUs with hours of notice. While we were able to maximally use our remaining fleet, we would not be able to fully restore service without our downed cluster coming back online.
Each fine-tuned model is very large in size. We have many fine-tuned models across all of our customers. Normally, we only load a few at a time from Azure Blob Storage. When we restore all fine-tuned services from scratch, we're massively bottlenecked by Azure Blob Storage bandwidth. This was made worse by cross-cluster data transfer. We normally have many layers of caching to alleviate this; however, the nature of this move invalidated all of those.
What happened to cluster restoration:
The cluster went down due to a combination of human error, unforeseen holes in our safeguards, and subtly missing information about the impacts of destructive operations. It took us until about 05:30 PDT (10½ hours) to restore this cluster. Our clusters are managed with Terraform and Kubernetes via Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Normally cluster creation is fairly quick. There were several unexpected issues that led to this taking a long time to restore.
During cluster setup we lost connection to AKS. After working with Azure support, we ended up rebuilding our VPN link to mitigate. We later unexpectedly lost connection again to Azure Private Link. We worked with Azure support again to build workarounds. We do not yet have a root cause of these issues and are actively working with Azure on cause and remediations.
A Kubernetes upgrade would alleviate some of these network problems. After performing the upgrade, we discovered our Ingress was incompatible with the new Kubernetes version. Fixing these ingress problems was not feasible given the time constraints, and we discovered that AKS does not allow Kubernetes downgrades.
We finally tore down and rebuilt the cluster again from scratch. This was successful and we began moving traffic back into this cluster between 05:30 and 06:30 PDT.
Remediations:
We are reprioritizing other product and engineering efforts to immediately dedicate significant resources to the following:
We are actively underway with several remediations to prevent this type of accident from happening again, ensure recovery is faster, and overall improve the performance of our infrastructure.
Adding checks and locks to prevent this and similar prod-critical pieces of infrastructure from being inadvertently modified. While we had some of these protections already in place, they were not comprehensive enough to cover the cluster failure mode that happened here.
Adding better visibility to operations being performed and ensuring parts of our system are more lexicographically distinct.
Continuing to work with Azure on AKS network connectivity issues to ensure this does not disrupt new cluster operations in the future.
Updating our playbooks with these new cluster failure modes and modifying new cluster and infrastructure setup steps.
Performing a systematic upgrade of Kubernetes and provisioning time to ensure we don't fall behind in the future.
Sharding our fine-tuned models across multiple clusters, and are working towards more automatic cross cluster replication strategies.
Distributing and replicating Azure Blob Storage to ensure fine-tuned models can load faster and more reliably.
Finish rolling out a node-to-node caching solution that can alleviate Azure Blob Storage bottlenecks.
Modifying the way we store model weights to be more efficient and faster to load.
We expect most of these remediations to be implemented within days and have reprioritized other efforts to immediately work on these improvements.",2022-06-24 02:02:00+00:00,2022-06-24 15:25:00+00:00,0 days 13:23:00,False
