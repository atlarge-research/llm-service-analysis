Outage on all models,https://status.openai.com/incidents/mq5jgswy45fr,#ef4146,impact-critical,"[{""Update_Title"": ""Postmortem"", ""Update_Body"": ""Starting at 11:15pm PST on Feb 20, 2023 we suffered a major outage across all endpoints and models of our service. /v1/completions traffic was restored by 2:05 am PST on Feb 21. Ongoing database instabilities left some non Completions services degraded until 1:30pm PST on Feb 21. The root cause was an unexpected database failure with compounding effects delaying full recovery.\nOur primary Postgres database was scheduled for a routine automated maintenance by our cloud provider. During this window, no impact was expected because the primary would fail over to a hot standby to continue to serve traffic. This ran as expected. However, additional \""read replica\"" databases were also scheduled for maintenance in the same time window but had no corresponding fail-over functionality. The read replicas unexpectedly failed to come back after their maintenance window. The result was that we were able to keep parts of the site up and running, but not enough database capacity to service all traffic.\nEngineers immediately started two streams of work. One was to create new read replicas. The other was to rebalance the available database connections towards the most critical API endpoints. Completions and authentication traffic were prioritized. This brought back traffic to the main /v1/completions endpoints by 2:05 am PT on Feb 21. The length was compounded by existing read replicas unexpectedly getting stuck in a recovery loop and being unable to reconnect to the primary database. This was additionally compounded by delays incurred spinning up new replicas due to unexpected dependencies from non-on-call staff in the middle of the night on a holiday weekend and during a holiday Monday on-call shift change.\nThroughout the night we continued to see database instabilities; however, isolation procedures were able to keep /v1/completions online. Unfortunately due the volume of ChatGPT and Dall-E these products remained degraded due to database instabilities.\nWe use PgBouncer to pool database connections; unfortunately in the post-recovery database configuration we identified previously unknown slow queries hogging the pools, preventing other queries to run. Database instabilities were further frustrated by new read replicas inadvertently bypassing PGBouncer and exceeding database connection limits. This caused an additional brief outage from 10:43 am to 11:04 am PT.\nBy 1:30pm read replicas were fully online and ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E returned to a fully operational status.\nWe are immediately executing on several action items as a result of this outage:\nWe are working with our cloud provider to be better prepared for how future maintenance will affect read replicas to minimize impact.\nWhenever possible, we will adjust maintenance windows to occur during normal working hours so more staff is readily available\nWe are adjusting caches to persist with longer TTLs if the database is unavailable, allowing some critical endpoints to continue functioning for longer.\nPgBouncer configuration is being tuned to account for slow queries\nWe are moving our on-call rotation to Tuesdays to avoid scheduling confusion of 3-day-weekend holidays.\nWe are reviewing our on-call access policies and escalation channels to ensure that on-call has knowledge and access to all necessary dependencies to remediate an outage\nLonger term, we are reviewing our overall database strategy and planning towards solutions that are more resilient to individual server failures."", ""Update_Timestamp"": ""Posted 2 years ago.

Capacity was fully stabilized in approximately four hours.\nThe problem was due to a configuration change of \""CNI\"" - the Container Network Interface plugins used to provide network connectivity to containers running on our clusters. Given the high demand of our services, we go to great lengths to utilize any and all GPU capacity available. This involves supporting a variety of different hardware and networking configurations, requiring different CNI configurations. We fully tested this CNI configuration change in a staging environment prior to deployment, but unfortunately our staging environment lacked one particular variation of hardware that only exists in production. The CNI change was incompatible with those servers and caused their workloads to lose network connectivity. \nEngineers immediately identified the problem as due to network connectivity, but it took nearly an hour for CNI to be identified as the cause. The CNI change had been deployed to other clusters over the past 24 hours, so had been deemed safe. The problem only arose once that change had been deployed to a cluster with different hardware. Once the problem was identified, a fix was in place and restored 80% of traffic immediately.\nThough the network and servers were back up and running, problems related to model deployment continued to affect our reliability over the subsequent 3 hours. Some issues were due to known bottlenecks in our network and storage infrastructure, limiting how many models we can load back onto GPUs at a time. Other issues are due to misbehaving bad hardware that need to be identified and removed from operation. We are actively working on addressing those limitations this quarter.\nWe are addressing several action items as a result of this incident. Staging environments will contain a representation of all possible types of hardware configurations so that it is a better representation of production. The health of our CNI system itself will be directly monitored and alerted, so that failures will be more readily visible.
