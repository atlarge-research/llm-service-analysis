Partial outage for GPT-4o free users,https://status.openai.com/incidents/mdbx834gwswg,#e86c09,impact-major,"[{""Update_Title"": ""Postmortem"", ""Update_Body"": ""On May 21, 2024 from 11:25 am PT  to 12:26 pm PT a large portion of requests to ChatGPT gpt-4o free tier were failing with 5xx status codes.\n\u200c\nAt 11:30 am PT, engineers noticed that the configured routing information for gpt-4o had no backing services anymore and took immediate action to reapply the expected configuration to the system. First, rate limits were decreased for free tier traffic to prevent overwhelming the few instances that would be backing gpt-4o. Traffic was slowly dialed back up as the system performing re-configuration slowly added more and more of the backing services to the routing configuration. Due to the nature of the systems, this configuration process ramps up traffic in a staged manner and takes several minutes in between steps to configure more capacity for a service, hence the large length of the incident relative the time to execution of a mitigation.\n\u200c\nThe root cause was later determined to be a code bug in a new code path to enable draining all workloads in a cluster, an operation that was being attempted for the first time.\nAn error in the logic led to a misconfiguration that resulted in 100% loss of the services that back gpt-4o free tier, spanning multiple clusters, instead of just impacting a single cluster. This meant there were no backing services configured to answer requests for gpt-4o free tier traffic, in line with the symptoms observed by the triaging engineer.\n\u200c\nThe core bug causing the incident has been fixed.\nFurther hardening is being undertaken to introduce inertia to the process of cluster drain as to avoid the same level of catastrophic loss and to prematurely warn operators before large actions are taken.\nThe systems are also being adapted to better explain specifically what actions will be performed when enacting such large operations.\nAdditionally, the team is making it easier to more quickly undo changes, something that prevented us from reverting the issue more quickly.\n\u200c\nWe know that outages to the ChatGPT service affect our customers. While we came up short here, we are committed to preventing such incidents in the future."", ""Update_Timestamp"": ""Posted 3 months ago.

This resulted in cascading failures across multiple services. The team shifted traffic away from the problem cluster to a healthy cluster, scaling that cluster up in the process. This caused the second cluster to fail as the increase of pods resulted in more requests to the control plane service that that cluster utilizes.\nRate limiting to reduce the inbound traffic volume was applied, which led to many users receiving a misleading error message.\n\u200c\nThe issue was mitigated by increasing the available memory on the Kubernetes control plane and rebalancing traffic.\n\u200c\nAs part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:\nAdjusted the available memory for control plane services.\nModified the services which make the majority of the requests to the control plane to reduce the volume of calls that they make.\nImplemented improved monitoring for the control plane and relevant other symptoms that we observed.\nModify the messages that users receive when using one of our rate limit configuration switches.\n\u200c\nAdditionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:\nMore thorough monitoring of the control plane services provided by our infrastructure provider.\n\u200c\nWe know that extended outages to ChatGPT affect our customers\u2019 products and business, and outages of this magnitude are particularly damaging.
