Elevated error rates for ChatGPT and Platform API,https://status.openai.com/incidents/s9d5cv5jcy7x,#e86c09,impact-major,"[{""Update_Title"": ""Postmortem"", ""Update_Body"": ""On August 16, 2024 from 11:38 AM to 1:16 PM PT, a significant issue impacted the reliability of the OpenAI primary API, resulting in degraded service for users. This incident led to reduced success rates for ChatGPT conversations and affected login and account creation processes. The incident occurred in two waves, lasting 44 and 15 minutes respectively.\n\u200c\nThe root cause was a combination of factors. A scheduled maintenance and an upgrade to the ingress of the OpenAI user-facing clusters introduced a networking control plane regression. This manifested itself in a short-lived data plane outage. As a result of the momentary loss of connectivity, a set of services became unhealthy and were automatically restarted. The restarts, however, took much longer than expected as the services starting up overwhelmed a backend persistence store with a heavy first-start query. The backend persistence store required additional time to catch up and recover.\n\u200c\nAs part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:\n\u200c\nWe have mitigated the networking control plane regression, and validated that control plane restarts do not interfere with the clusters' data plane\nWe implemented software changes to improve services' start time and remove first-start query alleviating pressure on the persistence layer and speeding up start and restart of services.\nDeployed configuration changes to optimize networking control plane's effect on clusters ability to handle traffic\nRemoved the expensive database query from critical startup paths\nImplemented additional monitoring and alerting for networking control-plane related issues\n\u200c\nAdditionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:\n\u200c\nWe are introducing staged rollouts for infrastructure changes with longer soak time to ensure regressions are caught as early as possible and affect as few systems and users as possible.\nWe are auditing our systems for other slow queries that may affect service start time.\n\u200c\nWe are continuing to improve our infrastructure to ensure greater resilience and faster recovery in the event of future incidents.\n\u200c\nWe know that extended API outages affect our customers\u2019 products and business, and outages of this magnitude are particularly damaging. While we came up short here, we are committed to preventing such incidents in the future and improving our service reliability."", ""Update_Timestamp"": ""Posted 8 days ago.

Due to recent infrastructure changes, and the deployment, we experienced an abnormally high number of requests to a schema service which led to increased latencies. A 3rd party library executing these requests used an IO-blocking behavior that caused processes to stall, resulting in ChatGPT requests timing out and returning 504 errors. We rolled forward to mitigate this and ChatGPT requests no longer experienced 504s.\n\u200c\nWe began to notice that conversations responses appeared to be successful but were usually empty. We identified that this is a regression due to recent code changes. The regression was fixed and we rolled forward again to mitigate the regression.\n\u200c\nAs part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:\nRemoved the IO-blocking behavior that occurred during event publishing.\nAdded caching to the schema service.\nImplemented additional monitoring for the schema service.\n\u200c\nAdditionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:\n\u200c\nReduce environment mismatch between testing and prod.\nAdd monitor for shortened ChatGPT responses\nImprove revert deploy time\nRemove the dependency on the schema service."", ""Update_Timestamp"": ""Posted 2 months ago.
