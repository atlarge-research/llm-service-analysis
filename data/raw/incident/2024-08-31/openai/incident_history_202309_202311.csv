Elevated Errors on API and ChatGPT,https://status.openai.com/incidents/n254wyd7nml7,#e86c09,impact-major,"[{""Update_Title"": ""Postmortem"", ""Update_Body"": ""On November 21st, between 1:48 - 5:21 PT a large portion of requests to OpenAI failed. This peaked at a 75% failure rate on paid and free ChatGPT.\nThis outage was triggered by maintenance on a PostgresDB service used by OpenAI\u2019s Primary API service that caused both read replicas to fail at the same time. Although only the read replicas for this database were affected, they are load-bearing, causing request paths dependent on them to fail. The Primary API service provides user authentication and service-to-service authentication across the entire OpenAI stack.\nAfter multiple unsuccessful attempts to both revive either of the failed replicas, as well as to bring up replacements in other regions, the issue was ultimately mitigated by working with our service provider to bring two new replicas in the same region into service.\n\u200c\nAs part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:\nA moratorium on similar maintenance activities till further notice.\nAdjusted configuration settings to reduce connection churn.\nAdded a feature flag which lets us shift traffic away from replicas on a percentage based rollout\nWe have tested directing 100% of the queries to the primary instance and verified our hypothesis of why the primary failed.\n\u200c\nAdditionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future similar incidents altogether:\nFundamentally OpenAI needs to ensure that maintenance windows do not result in widespread service outages. To that end we will:\nEstablish a pre-maintenance review process to review all upcoming maintenance activities to ensure that in the event of an unexpected outage, a plan to rapidly recover is in place.\nEnsure adequate buffer capacity is available as \u201chot\u201d standbys during maintenance activity.\nEnsure adequate buffer capacity is available in regions where critical services are hosted.\nThe DB maintenance caused the replicas to go offline/out of sync which led to replica lag increasing unboundedly. Develop (short term) strategy / automation for rapidly recovering from replica lag and (long term) architectural changes to eliminate this factor.\nExamine our entire infrastructure and services stack to ensure we add more redundancy and fail safe mechanisms for greater resilience.\nWe know that extended API outages affect our customers\u2019 products and business, and outages of this magnitude are particularly damaging.

Major Outage across ChatGPT and API,https://status.openai.com/incidents/00fpy0yxrx1q,#ef4146,impact-critical,"[{""Update_Title"": ""Postmortem"", ""Update_Body"": ""On November 8th between 5:42AM - 7:16AM PT a large portion of requests to OpenAI failed with 502 or 503 error codes. All models and API endpoints saw significant failures over the course of the event.\nThe outage occurred due to routing layer nodes hitting memory limits and failing readiness checks. Eventually, a sufficient number of nodes in the service became unavailable, that there wasn\u2019t sufficient capacity to serve the incoming traffic and the service was unable to recover. That morning, there were dramatically more completions than any prior day, which we believe was the sufficient tipping point for the service.\nThe issue was mitigated through a combination of limiting incoming traffic, redeploying the service en masse and then slowly ramping the traffic back up.\n\u200c\nAs part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:\n\u200c\nThe underlying issue which led to the chronic memory issues, was that we were continually allocating a new responseBuffer in a loop rather than reusing it. This was causing GC to get behind, particularly when there were lots of requests. The fix was to pre-allocate the buffer and reuse it. Since shipping, we have seen a 3X improvement in both memory and CPU usage.\nWe have adjusted the configured memory limits to an appropriate level and the service now has significant available headroom.\nWe have implemented a series of rate limit controls to more gracefully load shed traffic.\nAs an additional precaution, we increased the service\u2019s capacity.\n\u200c\nAdditionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:\nImplement a series of alerting changes to catch the underlying memory behavior before they escalate into potential service issues.\nIt was not possible to enable auto scaling on this service in the past as adding capacity to it could negatively impact an upstream service. The underlying issue has been rectified and we will configure auto scaling for this service.\nWe know that extended API outages affect our customers\u2019 products and business, and outages of this magnitude are particularly damaging.

This peaked at a 60% failure rate for GPT-3.5-Turbo API traffic, a 70% failure rate for GPT-4 API traffic, and similar failure rates for all other API endpoints. Additionally, a fraction of ChatGPT Enterprise traffic was affected as well.\nThe root cause was identified as our Redis authentication cache becoming largely unresponsive due to shards failing while the cache was already under high load. Because our authentication system was not resilient to such a cache failure, this led to a significant fraction of timeouts when authenticating. Due to the user-keyed nature of the authentication system, some users were heavily affected while others were not at all \u2013 some API customers saw all requests fail, while others only saw a small percentage fail.\nAfter identifying the root cause of the outage, we took immediate action by attempting to scale up the existing Redis cluster, as well as separately provisioning a new, larger Redis cluster with higher resource limits. However, fully restoring the service took longer than we anticipated. While the service improved periodically over the course of the outage, the issue was only fully mitigated by 9:15pm.\nAs part of the incident response, we have already implemented the following measures:\nScaled up the Redis authentication cache to be able to handle traffic even in the presence of multiple shard failures\nModified our cache miss and failure backoff policies to decrease the rate of requests to the cache when it is struggling to serve requests\nAdditionally, we will be implementing the following changes to prevent future incidents altogether:\nImprove monitoring and alerting for our caching and authentication infrastructure\nHardening our authentication system against degradations in caching services, so issues with our authentication caches don\u2019t take down all traffic.\nWe know that extended API outages affect our customers\u2019 products and business, and outages of this magnitude are particularly damaging.
